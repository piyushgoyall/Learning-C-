// GRAPH TERMINOLOGIES

// Directed Graph - A graph with directed edges is known as directed graph.
// Undirected Graph - A graph with undirected edges is known as undirected graph.

// Adjacent Vertices - Adjacent vertices are two vertices with a direct edge connecting them.

// Degree of a vertex
// There are two types of degrees: 
// Indegree: Number of incoming edges to a node.
// Outdegree: Number of outgoing edges from a node.

// Path between two vertices - All vertices which come in the path of two given vertices is called their path

// Connected Graph          |       Disconnected Graph
// Each node has path from  | Each node does not have path
// every other node.        | from every other node.

// Connected Component - Each connected graph in a disconnected graph is called a connected component.

// Cycles in a graph - Path from a vertex to the same vertex in a graph is known as cycle
// Cyclic Graph - Graph that contains cycle is called cyclic graph.
// Acyclic graph - Graph that does not contain cycle is called acyclic graph

// Tree 
// Tree is connected acyclic graph
// Properties of a Tree with n nodes:
// 1) Number of edges = n-1.
// 2) There are no cycles present.
// 3) Each node has path from every other vertex.

// Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
// As the name suggests, its properties are:
// 1) It has directed edges.
// 2) It is acyclic i.e. no cycles are present.

// Complete Graph - A graph in which each vertex is connected to every other vertex by a direct edge.
// Number of edges in a complete graph = nC2 = (n * (n-1)/2)

// Weighted Graph - A graph with weighted edges is called weighted graph.
