// Intersecting Segments
// Problem: Given an array of 2n numbers, each number from 1 to n in it occurs exactly twice. 
// We say that the segment y intersects the segment x if exactly one occurrence of the number y is between the occurrences of the number x. 
// Find for each segment, i how many segment are there that intersect with i'th segment.
